# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 This project utilized Kickstarter's database to practice data visualization techniques in Excel. Functions such as PivotTables, quartile calculation, countifs, and auto-generated charts were the key components of parsing through specific filters of data that may be useful to make predictions about similar campaigns.

### Purpose
By extrapolating data from a wide range of Kickstarter campaigns, I aim to assist the client, Louise, determine optimal characteristics of a successful campaign for a play. Ideally, with the data provided, the client will be better equipped to launch a successful campaign and meet their goal, achieving the funding necessary to realize their crowdfunded product.

## Analysis and Challenges
Initial analysis of the specific criteria Louise is working toward indicates three trends of near-certainty: campaigns for plays do not cancel, summer campaigns are the most successful, and campaigns are more successful when the final goal is less than $15,000. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As a whole, the present data indicates that the most successful campaigns for theater products begin in May or June, and plays fare slightly better in May. That said, May is also the launch month of the most failures for plays, as well as the highest number of campaign launches which can lead to oversaturation (see below.) My direct advisement to Louise is to begin their campaign in late April so that outreach can begin before the rush in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data is very clear when it comes to the “sweet spot” of plays being successfully funded: aiming to acquire less than ten thousand dollars is ideal. In fact, the most successful goal is two thousand dollars, with three thousand as a close second. Be that as it may, that is hardly enough money to launch a production with big-ticket assets, so perhaps it is best that the client is very honest about the budget constraints of the play itself. Naturally, there are outliers that indicate a lofty campaign goal can be funded, even up to sums greater than 35 thousand dollars. However, these particular campaigns often tout an average donation much higher than those with lower goals, some upwards of $500. Unfortunately, the data present is insufficient to reveal if these high averages come from a handful of multi-thousand dollar donations.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The initial difficulty I would indicate to Louise and any client looking to create a Kickstarter campaign for theater is the primary concern of any arts funding: taste. While it is well and good to analyze the ideal monetary goals, and launch date for a campaign, success almost certainly relies on outreach to potential audience. This is not to say that the only contributors to artistic product are the target audience, but the content itself must have an apparent draw to its launch environment. 

## Results
The results of this study are as follows: Louise would do well to aim for a low fundraising goal, launch by end of Q1, and keep her audience base in the US. While this may not have been part of the initial ask of the client, I would like to provide insight into successful genres of theater (not just plays) though a powerful outreach campaign does pose the possibility to overcome the obstacle of audience taste.
