# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 This project utilized Kickstarter's database to practice data visualization techniques in Excel. Functions such as PivotTables, quartile calculation, countifs, and auto-generated charts were the key components of parsing through specific filters of data that may be useful to make predictions about similar campaigns.

### Purpose
By extrapolating data from a wide range of Kickstarter campaigns, I aim to assist the client, Louise, determine optimal characteristics of a successful campaign for a play. Ideally, with the data provided, the client will be better equipped to launch a successful campaign and meet their goal, achieving the funding necessary to realize their crowdfunded product.
